# Problem 3

## Task 3.1
We used inlining on `report` as the code was actually quite pure but the specification not so.
We used contracts on `eliminateDuplicates` and `search` the contract helped more than the loops.

We had to manually instantiate T from the forall loop on self.query to properly close the proof.

## Task 3.2

The JML specification had a require line which was not enforced by the implementation,

`@ requires numbers.length == 0 && numbers != null;`

was implemented using

```
    if (numbers != null && numbers.length == 0) {
      this.size = -1;
      throw new RuntimeException("");
    }
```

## Task 3.3

Proof is supplied.

The minor error was that the loop invariant did not hold __after__ the loop has ended.
The loop invariant was modified from

`@ 0 <= i && i < canvas[depth].length` to
`@ 0 <= i && i <= canvas[depth].length`

# Problem 4
We implemented the code for all the function according to the specifications in NumericTextBox.java.
Each function were then proven using KeY, the proofs are handed in with the solution.
Some alterations to the code and JML were needed during the process when errors were found.
