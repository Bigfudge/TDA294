# Problem 3

## Task 3.1
We used inlining on `report` as the code was actually quite pure but the specification not so.
We used contracts on `eliminateDuplicates` and `search` the contract helped more than the loops.

We had to manually instantiate T from the forall loop on self.query to properly close the proof.

## Task 3.2

The JML specification had a require line which was not enforced by the implementation,

`@ requires numbers.length == 0 && numbers != null;`

was implemented using

```
    if (numbers != null && numbers.length == 0) {
      this.size = -1;
      throw new RuntimeException("");
    }
```

## Task 3.3

Proof is supplied.

The minor error was that the loop invariant did not hold __after__ the loop has ended.
The loop invariant was modified from

`@ 0 <= i && i < canvas[depth].length` to
`@ 0 <= i && i <= canvas[depth].length`
